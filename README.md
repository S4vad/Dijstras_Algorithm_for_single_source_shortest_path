# Dijkstra's Algorithm - Single Source Shortest Path

This repository implements Dijkstra's Algorithm in JavaScript for finding the shortest path between a single source and all other nodes in a weighted graph. It includes two versions of the implementation, showcasing different approaches for the priority queue.

## üöÄ Features

- **Efficient Shortest Path Calculation:** Uses Dijkstra's algorithm with a weighted graph.
- **Two Priority Queue Implementations:**
  - **Version 1:** Simple priority queue with array-based sorting.
  - **Version 2:** Optimized priority queue using a binary heap for improved performance.

## üìú About the Algorithm

Dijkstra's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm used for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph with non-negative weights. It is widely used in navigation systems, network routing, and other fields requiring shortest-path computations.

**Use Cases:**
- GPS navigation systems
- Network routing protocols
- AI pathfinding algorithms

## üìÇ Code Versions

### **Version 1**
In this version:
- The priority queue is implemented using an **array**.
- Nodes are sorted after every `enqueue` operation based on their priority.
- Simpler implementation but less efficient.

---

### **Version 2**
In this version:
- The priority queue is implemented using a **binary heap** for better efficiency.
- Includes custom `Node` objects for each graph vertex.
- More optimized, especially for large graphs, as insertion and deletion operations in the heap are faster.
